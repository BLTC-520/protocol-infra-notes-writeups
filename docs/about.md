# About

Hi, I’m **Brian Har**.

I’m currently working as a **Java Software Engineer**, but my main focus is pivoting into:

- **Blockchain / Protocol Infrastructure**
- **RPC / Node Operations**
- **SRE / Reliability Engineering**
- **L2 ecosystem (OP Stack style infra)**

This site is my public learning log — where I document what I build, what breaks, and how I fix it.

## What I’m building in 2026

- Ethereum node + RPC infrastructure labs  
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus / Grafana)
- Incident-style debugging + runbooks
- Automation scripts to reduce manual ops work
- Open-source contributions (node + infra tooling)

## Tech I’m focusing on

- **Rust / Go**
- **Linux systems & networking**
- **AWS + Terraform**
- **Docker / Kubernetes**
- **Prometheus / Grafana**
- **Ethereum execution/consensus clients**
